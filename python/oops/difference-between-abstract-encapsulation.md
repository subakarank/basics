| **Aspect**          | **Abstraction**                                                                                                                                                                     | **Encapsulation**                                                                                                                                    |

| **Definition**      | Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It defines what an object does, not how it does it.            | Encapsulation is the technique of bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class.       |
| **Purpose**         | Simplifies complexity by providing a clear interface and hiding implementation details.                                                                                            | Protects the internal state of an object and controls access to it.                                                                                  |
| **Implementation**  | Achieved using abstract classes and interfaces which define methods without implementing them.                                                                                      | Achieved by using classes to bundle data and methods, and by using access control mechanisms to restrict access to the data.                         |
| **Focus**           | Focuses on what an object does (its behavior).                                                                                                                                     | Focuses on how an object's data is accessed and modified (data protection and hiding).                                                               |
| **Access Control**  | Does not involve access control mechanisms. Abstract classes/interfaces do not control how subclasses implement the defined methods.                                                | Involves access control using private, protected, and public access modifiers to restrict direct access to an object's data.                         |
| **Visibility**      | Provides a high-level interface for objects. The user knows what methods are available but not how they are implemented.                                                           | Controls the visibility of data within the object. The user may not be able to see or modify the internal state directly.                            |
| **Data Protection** | Does not inherently protect data; focuses on method signatures and ensuring consistent interfaces.                                                                                  | Protects the internal state of an object from unintended or unauthorized access and modification.                                                    |
| **Ease of Use**     | Makes complex systems easier to use by providing a simplified interface.                                                                                                           | Ensures that the internal state of an object can only be changed in controlled ways, improving reliability and maintainability.                      |
