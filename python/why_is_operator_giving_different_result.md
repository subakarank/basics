### Explanation:

```
x = 5 
y = 5
z = x 

print(x is y ) # True
print(z is x) # True

 ```



In Python, the `is` operator checks if two variables point to the same object in memory, rather than just having equal values. 

Since integers in Python are immutable, the Python interpreter optimizes memory usage by reusing the same object for small integers, such as `5`. So when you check `x is y`, it returns `True` because both `x` and `y` are referring to the same integer object `5` in memory.

However, it's important to note that this behavior might not always hold true for larger integers or other types of objects. For example:

```python
x = 500
y = 500
print(x is y)  # This might print False, as larger integers aren't necessarily cached in the same way. 

```
 

In CPython (the most commonly used implementation of Python), integers from -5 to 256 (inclusive) are cached and reused. This means that whenever you create an integer within this range, Python will reuse the same object in memory rather than creating a new one. This optimization is done for performance reasons since small integers are frequently used.

```

x = 5
y = 5
print(x is y)  # True

x = 256
y = 256
print(x is y)  # True

x = 257
y = 257
print(x is y)  # False


```
